\title{Generate Levels with Unequal Sample SIzes}
\description{
Produces a vector of samples of unequal sizes. Useful when observations are already sorted into groups by levels.
}
\usage{
gl.unequal(n = "number of levels", k = "numeric vector of sample sizes")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n}{Scalar determining the number of levels.}
  \item{k}{Numeric vector specifying the sample size at each level.}
}
\value{Produces a factored vector.}
